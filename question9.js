+ Create a 500 element array and load the array with a series of numbers starting at the first position that
is the square of the index. For example, at position 0 would be 0, at position 1 would be 1, at position 2
       -------------------
would be 4, at position 3 would be 9â€¦. Etc.

+ Ask the user for a number between 0 and 250,000 and let them know if that number is a square.
Employ a binary search.
